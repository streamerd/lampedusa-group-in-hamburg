                    With the beggining of the military invention of NATO against Libya many workers and foreigners had to escape from Libya. 
                    Because of the new situation for most of the workers it was not safe anymore to stay. 
                    There was a high risk that the army could force them to take guns and to get involved in the fight. 
                    The only option that time seemed to go back to the homeland, but it was difficult to move out from Libya. 
                    Another option was taking the risk to cross the sea.
